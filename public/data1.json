      "description":"Racing Penguin (or Flying Penguin) is a physics based slide and fly game!\n\nSlide down the mountains of Antarctica and flap your wings to fly.\n\nGo as fast as you can to escape from the polar bear.\n\n5 addicting worlds, 40 racing levels.\n\nClear levels to earn stars - the faster you go, the more stars you get.\n\nUse your stars to unlock new worlds!\n\nMultiplayer! You can challenge your friends!\n\nGet it while it is FREE!\n\n● What our players are saying\n\n- If it where a $10 game I would buy it. I can play it everyday for the rest of my life\n\n- This is the funnest mobile game in the history of mobile games\n\n- This game was so much fun I lost my job and my wife left me. I sure hope they will reimburse me for my life.\n\n- Fantabulous. Hide this one from the kids, you're gonna want to spend some quality\ntime playing this one yourself\n\n- This game changed my life\n\n\n● other FREE games you should play\n\n- Zombie Tower Defense\nHow does the human race era and civilization empires we've been living in will end: diseases like ebola? Or UFOs invading us with their sci-fi weapons and rockets? Or dragons and those fantasy ? Nuclear and military warfare? Some kind of crazy criminal boss attacking major cities in America? NO! The correct answer is ZOMBIES! Trust me, zombies are the most deadly and imminent menace to society. Obviously we must battle and shoot them at all costs. What about a 3D game where your role is exactly that one? Sounds cool, hah? Zombie Tower Defense is action packed strategy game\n\n- Spider Monkey\nThe greatest jumping adventure on planet earth! The perfect mix of 2D platformer arcade game with beautiful scenarios and awesome physics-based gameplay. Jump across all types of obstacles to complete the levels but please avoid holes, spikes and dangerous enemies – you don't want those nice monkeys to die, do you? Simple and intuitive controls: just tap anywhere to jump. Just leave that console in the living room – after all, who needs a joystick to have fun nowadays?\n\n- Mouse Maze\nClassic pac-man maze with arcade style fully reimagined for mobile devices. Collect the items and kill the aliens (actually allien cats, i.e., cats from some outer space's UFO invading our planet). Where else would you could buy a mouse that shoots lasers and burns cats? This is right mix of retro style arcade and challenging puzzler game. Feeling smart? Characters may look cute, but you gotta practice brain training and use logic to swipe, match, connect, and navigate the correct paths.\n\n- Cool Race\nDidn't you know that mammoths are crazy about speed, racing and competition? Oh boy! They do, they really do! Run as fast as your can and become the pole position and mighty champion of prehistoric animal races! Our favorite mammoth is the fighter, he is the master of martial art skills with crazy kung fu jumps and enhance your abilities with legendary pets and dragons from fantasy land! Compete against millions of other mammoths in the multiplayer mode! Believe me, it's double, triple, 4x fun\n\n- Top Quiz\nThe game everyone is talking about! Look at the pictures and guess the answer! Can you recognize the celebrities and stars from television, movies and sports? There are also lots of trivia from logos, pop culture, and video games. Definitely not one of those boring word or number games! Play Top Quiz against your friends or random people from all around the world. Prove that you're the smartest!", "currency":"USD", "genres":["Games", "Arcade", "Action", "Entertainment"], "genreIds":["6014", "7003", "7001", "6016"], "releaseDate":"2011-06-16T23:45:56Z", "sellerName":"Top Free Games", "bundleId":"com.topfreegames.racingpenguinfree", "trackId":443637419, "trackName":"Racing Penguin, Flying Free - by Top Free Games", "primaryGenreName":"Games", "primaryGenreId":6014, "releaseNotes":"+ Minor bug fixes", "minimumOsVersion":"5.0", "wrapperType":"software", "formattedPrice":"Free", "trackCensoredName":"Racing Penguin, Flying Free - by Top Free Games", "languageCodesISO2A":["EN"], "fileSizeBytes":"35643573", "contentAdvisoryRating":"4+", "averageUserRatingForCurrentVersion":4.5, "userRatingCountForCurrentVersion":685,

      "description":"When the thermometer rises, bring it back down with a refreshing, chilling, ICEE!  Think you’re craving this legendary drink now?  Just wait until you build the ultimate, irresistible combination of flavors in ICEE MAKER!  Your taste buds will take you to the nearest ICEE machine! \n  \nLet the fun begin by choosing your cup and lid or create your very own cup design!  Next, choose from 20 different ICEE flavors, or create and name your very own flavor.  Show off your skills and become an official ICEE mixologist!  \n\nWhen it’s time to clean the machine, don’t worry, it’s much more fun than real life cleaning!  Once you’ve made that machine sparkle like new, personalize your cool creation with ICEE bear decals and other fun ICEE stickers.  And who could forget the straw?  Dig in and choose one of many swirly, curly, twirly straws.  You can even add colored stripes and logos to your straw!  \n  \nNow that your drink is just the way you like it, slurp it down and enjoy it to the last drop, share it on Facebook, email it to a friend, or save it in the freezer to enjoy later!  Maybe you’re up for an ICEE challenge?  See how many ICEEs you can drink in 30 seconds, but be sure to pace yourself… if you drink too fast, you will get a brain freeze!   After all, ICEEs were made to be perfect, not painful!   You won’t need snow cones, popsicles, ice pops or frozen yogurt when you can enjoy the absolute coolest treat around with ICEE MAKER!\n\nThanks for making us the #1 APP on the ENTIRE app store!
